# landing-page
landing page project from TOP

Second project building a website from scratch. The assignment is to build this site using skills used from the foundations course to match a picture provided by TOP. For starters I will build this exactly as directed. I would like to have this, in the end, be an example site for a business for the portfolio.

Main goal with this is to put into practice all the html and css I've learned before moving on to learning Java.
